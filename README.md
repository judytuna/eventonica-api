Build a REST API

1. Fork and clone this repo, which is mostly empty.
2. Create a new package.json file with npm's defaults by typing: `npm init -y`
3. Add express to your project by typing: `npm i --save express`
   1. Note: `i` is short for install =) `npm i` is equivalent to writing `npm install`.
   2. If you had just typed `npm i express`, you'd have just downloaded the express library (and its dependencies) to your project's node_modules folder.
   3. However, since you used the `--save` flag, `npm i --save express` not only downloaded the express library and saved it to your project's node_modules folder, it also adds it to your package.json under "dependencies".
